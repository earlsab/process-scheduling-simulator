## Process Scheduling Simulator using egui for Rust.

A lot of ChatGPT/Github Copilot was used for the timeline drawer. \
Project's main purpose was to throw myself into a task to understand rust.

### Tested

Works with examples from \
Understanding Operating Systems (6th Edition) \
by Ann McIver McHoes & Ida M. Flynn
p.g. 116-126

### To Note

- Not sure how to run aarch64-apple-darwin build of project. `Mac users` might have better luck building the project themselves.
- `Windows users` might need to get around their windows defender. When prompt comes up click "More info" then click "Run anyways".
- Project might be using a lot of rust anti-patterns as I'm still learnning
- Might have a lot of spagetti code hehe. Sorry future self, didn't mean to disappoint.
